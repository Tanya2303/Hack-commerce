# EcoGreen

## 💡 Inspiration

The environment has to be preserved and restored since human activity has gravely harmed many ecosystems. The actual amount of trash thrown annually is 2.12 billion tonnes, which has a huge impact on climate change. Even though less than 10% of waste is recycled by most people, the EPA estimates that 75% of rubbish can be recycled (or at least partially utilized). This inspired us to create EcoGreen, a website platform that enables users to successfully sell or donate their unused goods and purchase items from other users. We aim to use this platform to bring people together around a common cause and help the world become a cleaner environment.

## 💻 What it does

On EcoGreen users can:

- They can also sell their own items.
- Buy recycled items such as clothes and furniture.
- They can also donate their items to charity.
- For every item they donate, they get a reward in the form of coupons.

## ⚙️ How we built it

- React Js: For frontend
- Firebase: For backend
- Firebase Storage: For storing images
- Tailwind CSS: For easy styling
